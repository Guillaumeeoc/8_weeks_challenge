# CONTEXT 

Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway…)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

# DATASETS 

Six datasets : 
* runners
* runners_orders
* customer_orders
* pizza_names
* pizza_recipes
* pizza_toppings 

## ERD 

![erd](img/erd_pizza_runner.png)


## TABLE 1 : RUNNERS 

The `runners` table is composed of : 
- **runner_id** - PRIMARY KEY
- **registration_date** - Registration date of a runner_id

![runners_table](img/runners_table.PNG)

## TABLE 2 : CUSTOMER_ORDERS

The `customer_orders` table is composed of : 
- **order_id** - FOREIGN KEY
- **customer_id** - FOREIGN KEY
- **pizza_id** - FOREIGN KEY
- **exclusions** - ingredient_id values which should be removed from the pizza 
- **extras** - ingredient_id values which should be added to the pizza 
- **order_time** - ordered day and time of the pizza

![customer_orders_table](img/customer_orders_table.PNG)

## TABLE 3 : RUNNER_ORDERS

The `runners_orders` table is composed of : 
- **order_id** - FOREIGN KEY
- **runner_id** - FOREIGN KEY
- **pickup_time** -  the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizza
- **distance** - distance to deliver the pizza
- **duration** - time to deliver the pizza
- **cancellation** - if there is a restaurant cancellation or a customer cancellation

![runner_orders_table](img/runner_orders_table.PNG)

## TABLE 4 : PIZZA_NAMES

The `pizza_names` table is composed of : 
- **pizza_id** - PRIMARY KEY
- **pizza_name** - name of the pizza

![pizza_names_table](img/pizza_names_table.PNG)

## TABLE 5 : PIZZA_RECIPES

The `pizza_recipes` table is composed of : 
- **pizza_id** - FOREIGN KEY
- **toppings** - ingrediens on the pizza

![pizza_recipes_table](img/pizza_recipes_table.PNG)

## TABLE 6 : PIZZA_TOPPINGS

The `pizza_toppings` table is composed of : 
- **topping_id** - PRIMARY KEY
- **topping_name** - ingredient name

![pizza_toppings_table](img/pizza_toppings_table.PNG)

# CASE STUDY 

Before we are going further, we have to clean two datasets : `customer_orders` and `runner_orders`. 

**Creating Views with data cleaning**

1. In `customer_orders`, we have to set values to NULL when we don't any exclusion or extra ingrediens.
2. In `runner_orders`, we have to delete "km" from distance column and "minutes", "mins" or "minute" from duration column. We also need to set NULL value when there is not cancellation. 

All the 'null' values already in the datasets are in STRING type. We have to convert all in the correct NULL value.
