# CONTEXT 

Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

# DATASETS 

Six datasets : 
* plans 
* subscriptions 

# ERD

# CASE STUDY 

Before we are going to deep into this case study, we have to prepare our work with views (schema + views) : 

```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS v_foodie_fi CASCADE; 
CREATE SCHEMA v_foodie_fi; 

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_foodie_fi.plans; 
CREATE VIEW v_foodie_fi.plans AS
SELECT * FROM foodie_fi.plans; 


DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_foodie_fi.subscriptions; 
CREATE VIEW v_foodie_fi.subscriptions AS
SELECT * FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions; 
```

## Customer Journey

```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  plans.plan_id, 
  start_date, 
  plans.plan_name, 
  RANK() OVER(
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY start_date
  )
FROM v_foodie_fi.subscriptions
INNER JOIN v_foodie_fi.plans 
  ON subscriptions.plan_id = plans.plan_id
WHERE customer_id in (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19);
```

- **CUSTOMER 1**
Trial of 7 days then basic monthly subscription 
- **CUSTOMER 2**
Trial of 7 days then annual subscription
- **CUSTOMER 11**
Trial of 7 days then **churn** 
- **CUSTOMER 13**
Basic monthly subscription during 3 months then pro monthly subscription
- **CUSTOMER 15**
Trial of 7 days then pro monthly subscription for one month (**churn** after). 
- **CUSTOMER 16**
Trial of 7 days then basic monthly subscription and after 4 months annual subscription
- **CUSTOMER 18**
Trial of 7 days then pro monthly subscription
- **CUSTOMER 19**
Trial of 7 days then pro monthly subscription and annual subscription after 2 months.
